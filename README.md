## Key Features

1. **Authentication:**
   - Basic Authentication for initial account creation.
   - Bearer Token Authentication for securing subsequent API calls.

2. **CRUD Operations:**
   - **Vehicles:**
     - Admins and Car Owners can add new vehicles and update their details.
     - Mechanics and Owners can view a vehicle's maintenance history.
   - **Maintenance Logs:**
     - Mechanics can add service records to a vehicle's maintenance log.
     - Admins can review all service logs for quality control.
   - **Parts Inventory:**
     - Mechanics and Admins can add, update, and remove parts from the inventory.
     - Admins can manage pricing and availability.

3. **Access Control List (ACL):**
   - Admins have full control over user and data management.
   - Mechanics access only their assigned vehicles and maintenance logs.
   - Car Owners can only see and modify their own vehicle records.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Mongoose for database modeling

---

## Security

- Basic authentication for initial account creation ensures secure user registration.
- Bearer token authentication is implemented to secure subsequent API calls.
- Access control lists are enforced to restrict user access based on their roles.

## Database Design

- **Tables:**
  1. Users: Store user account information, roles, and authentication tokens.
  2. Vehicles: Hold vehicle data including VIN, model, and owner information.
  3. Maintenance Logs: Record service history for vehicles (date, type, description, mechanic ID).
  4. Parts Inventory: Maintain details of parts available for repairs (name, type, quantity, price).

## Endpoints

1. `/vehicles` - For adding/viewing vehicles.
2. `/vehicles/:id/logs` - For managing specific vehicle logs.
3. `/logs/:id` - For updating/removing logs.
4. `/inventory` - For managing parts.
